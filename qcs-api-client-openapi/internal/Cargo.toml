# Before updating `serde`, check for the following:
#
# 1. Has support been added for retaining the tag field for internally tagged enums?
# 2. Has support been added for deserializing into a default enum variant if the tag
#    does not match other variants or is not present?
#
# If 1 *and* 2 are true, then `src/models/channels/manual_serde.rs` can be removed,
# along with the relevant parts of `scripts/patch_generated_code.sh`, and the derived
# versions of the traits can be used along with the above features.
#
# Otherwise, make sure that `manual_serde.rs` still compiles with the newer version,
# as it uses `serde` modules not covered by semver.
