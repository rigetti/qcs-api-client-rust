  title: Rigetti QCS API
  version: 2020-07-31
  description: >
    # Introduction


    This is the documentation for the Rigetti QCS HTTP API.


    You can find out more about Rigetti at [https://rigetti.com](https://rigetti.com), and also

    interact with QCS via the web at [https://qcs.rigetti.com](https://qcs.rigetti.com).


    This API is documented in **OpenAPI format** and so is compatible with the dozens of

    language-specific client generators available

    [here](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) and elsewhere on the web.


    # Principles


    This API follows REST design principles where appropriate, and otherwise an HTTP RPC paradigm.

    We adhere to the Google [API Improvement Proposals](https://google.aip.dev/general) where

    reasonable to provide a consistent, intuitive developer experience. HTTP response codes match

    their specifications, and error messages fit a common format.


    # Authentication


    All access to the QCS API requires OAuth2 authentication provided by Okta. You can request

    access [here](https://www.rigetti.com/get-quantum). Once you have a user account, you can download

    your access token from QCS [here](https://qcs.rigetti.com/auth/token). 


    That access token is valid for 24 hours after issuance. The value of `access_token` within the

    JSON file is the token used for authentication (don't use the entire JSON file).


    Authenticate requests using the `Authorization` header and a `Bearer` prefix:


    ```

    curl --header "Authorization: Bearer eyJraW...Iow"

    ```


    # Quantum Processor Access


    Access to the quantum processors themselves is not yet provided directly by this HTTP API, but

    is instead performed over ZeroMQ/[rpcq](https://gitlab.com/rigetti/rpcq). Until that changes,

    we suggest using [pyquil](https://gitlab.com/rigetti/pyquil) to build and execute quantum

    programs via the Legacy API.


    # Legacy API


    Our legacy HTTP API remains accessible at https://forest-server.qcs.rigetti.com, and it shares

    a source of truth with this API's services. You can use either service with the same user

    account and means of authentication. We strongly recommend using the API documented here, as the

    legacy API is on the path to deprecation.

      Additionally, errors returned with code `invalid_input` *may* include additional detail under the `validationErrors`

      attribute. Note, not all validation errors will specify a `path`, but they will contain a message. Please heed those

      messages *in addition to* the top level error message.

      description: >-
        Represents the logical underlying architecture of a quantum processor.


        The architecture is defined in detail by the nodes and edges that constitute the quantum

        processor. This defines the set of all nodes that could be operated upon, and indicates to

        some approximation their physical layout. The main purpose of this is to support geometry

        calculations that are independent of the available operations, and rendering ISA-based

        information. Architecture layouts are defined by the `family`, as follows.


        The "Aspen" family of quantum processor indicates a 2D planar grid layout of octagon unit

        cells. The `node_id` in this architecture is computed as :math:`100 p_y + 10 p_x + p_u` where

        :math:`p_y` is the zero-based Y position in the unit cell grid, :math:`p_x` is the zero-based

        X position in the unit cell grid, and :math:`p_u` is the zero-based position in the octagon

        unit cell and always ranges from 0 to 7. This scheme has a natural size limit of a 10x10

        unit cell grid, which permits the architecture to scale up to 800 nodes.


        Note that the operations that are actually available are defined entirely by `Operation`

        instances. The presence of a node or edge in the `Architecture` model provides no guarantee

        that any 1Q or 2Q operation will be available to users writing QUIL programs.

        * Expressions are always of the form `{field} {operator} {value}` and may be grouped with `()` and joined with `AND` or `OR`.

        * Fields are specific to the route in question, but are typically a subset of attributes of the requested resource.

        * Operators are limited to `=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, and `!=`.

        * Values may take the following forms:
          * `true` or `false` for boolean fields
          * a number
          * a string (include surrounding `"`s),
          * a duration string (include surrounding `"`s). Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
          * a date string (include surrounding `"`s). Should be formatted [RFC3339 5.6](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6).

        For example, `startTime >= "2020-06-24T22:00:00.000Z" OR (duration >= "15m" AND endTime < "2020-06-24T22:00:00.000Z")`.
